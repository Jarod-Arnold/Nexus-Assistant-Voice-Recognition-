# Nexus Voice Assistant V0.1
This is a personal project dedicated to voice commands and task automation using Python. I've been developing this for a few months and haven't worked out all the bugs or flushed out the features. 

Each activation of the voice recognition will only run one(1) command. 

# How to Use (With an IDE)
- Run the 'Nexus_Main0.1'.py file in your IDE.
- Press F5 (or the start script button in your IDE).
- Press F12 to initiate voice recognition (there will be an audible beep when activating)
- Clearly speak the command you'd like to run (search the web for, open application, etc...)

# Technology Used
- Python
- Speech recognition (speech_recognition)
- Text to Speech (pyttsx3)
- Keyboard
- Threading
- Winsound

# Features 
- Macro recording and playback
- Search the web
- Open hardcoded or spoken websites ('open website youtube.com')
- Set TTS voice volume (0-100)
- Open and close hardcoded applications
- Automated typing ('nexus write this "state things to type here"')
- Common hotkeys (copy, paste, close tab (chrome))
- TTS states current local time

# To-do List
- Implement NLP
- Implement usage of ChatGPT or similiar component
- Add timers, reminders, and alarms
- Add toggle for continuous listening and single press listen (multiple spoken commands vs single spoken command)
- Possibly create GUI using Tkinter or PyQt6

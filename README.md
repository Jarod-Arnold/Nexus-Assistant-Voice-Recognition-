# Nexus Voice Assistant V0.1
This is a personal project dedicated to voice commands and task automation using Python. I've been developing this for a few months and haven't worked out all the bugs or flushed out the features. 

Each activation of the voice recognition will only run one(1) command. 

# How to Use (With an IDE)
- Run the 'Nexus_Main0.1'.py file in your IDE.
- Press F5 (or the start script button in your IDE).
- Press F12 to initiate voice recognition (there will be an audible beep when activating)
- Clearly speak the command you'd like to run (search the web for, open application, etc...)

# Technology Used
- Python
- Speech recognition (speech_recognition)
- Text to Speech (pyttsx3)
- Keyboard
- Threading
- Winsound
